# Prompt for Iterative Implementation

I want you to implement a feature for me, but I want to follow a strict **Design-First, Iterative Approach**. Please follow these steps:

1.  **Deep Design Phase**:
    *   First, analyze the problem and current codebase.
    *   Create a design document (Markdown) detailing the problem, constraints, proposed solution, and technical implementation plan.
    *   **Do not write any implementation code yet.**
    *   Ask for my approval on the design before moving forward.

2.  **Iterative Implementation**:
    *   Once the design is approved, break the implementation into small, verifiable steps (e.g., Step 1: UI only, Step 2: Logic connection, Step 3: Data persistence).
    *   Implement **one step at a time**.
    *   After each step, stop and ask me to verify/test that specific part.
    *   Only proceed to the next step once the current one is confirmed working.

The goal is to ensure stability and catch conflicts early. Start by creating the design document for: [DESCRIBE YOUR FEATURE HERE]
